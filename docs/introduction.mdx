Why I built this project?

</h1>

<div className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 space-y-6">

<p className="mb-6">
  We are living in a new era of software development where speed has become the
  most critical skill for everyone.{" "}
  <strong>
    Shipping fast is no longer just an advantage—it's a necessity.
  </strong>
</p>

<p className="mb-6">
  This is especially true in web development. The traditional approach to
  building user interfaces is becoming increasingly outdated. As a frontend
  developer, if you're working in a startup and waiting for designers to
  finalize high-fidelity mockups or prototypes, you're likely facing significant
  delays. Even if the designs are cutting-edge, translating them into functional
  code can be time-consuming and challenging. This is what we often refer to as
  the "gap" between designers and frontend (or UI) engineers.
</p>

<p className="mb-6">
  However, a new role has emerged in recent years to bridge this gap: The Design
  Engineer.
</p>

<p className="mb-6">
  From my point of view, I believe we ( **Design Engineers** ) can reduce
  development time by up to 75% if we skip the planning and thinking phase and
  develop directly for production.
</p>

<p className="mb-6">
  How? By leveraging pre-built, reusable components created by engineers who
  possess a strong understanding of UI/UX design and exceptional skills in
  front-of-the-frontend development.
</p>

<p className="mb-6">
  Instead of starting from scratch, we can simply copy and paste these
  components, saving time and ensuring consistency.
</p>

<p className="mb-6">
  This approach not only accelerates the development process but also fosters
  better collaboration between designers and developers, ultimately leading to
  faster and more efficient product delivery.
